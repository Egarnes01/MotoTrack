1. Product Vision Statement

MotoTrack is a web-based motorcycle maintenance and service tracking application designed for everyday motorcycle riders who want a simple and organized way to manage their bike’s maintenance history.

Motorcycle owners often rely on memory, handwritten notes, or scattered phone reminders to track service tasks such as oil changes, chain adjustments, tire replacements, and inspections. This inconsistency can lead to missed maintenance intervals, reduced performance, safety risks, and unnecessary repair costs. MotoTrack provides a centralized, easy-to-use platform that allows riders to log maintenance, monitor mileage, and track service intervals in one secure location. The product delivers value by improving safety, protecting long-term bike performance, and helping maintain resale value.

2. Initial Product Backlog
Backlog Item	Description	Priority
User Authentication System	Implement secure user registration, login, and logout functionality	High
Database Schema Design	Design relational database structure for users, motorcycles, and maintenance logs	High
Create Motorcycle Profile	Allow users to add motorcycle details (make, model, year, mileage)	High
Update Mileage Feature	Allow users to update bike mileage to keep records accurate	High
Maintenance Log Entry	Enable users to record maintenance events (oil change, tire replacement, etc.)	High
View Maintenance History	Display maintenance history in chronological order	High
Service Interval Tracking Logic	Calculate when maintenance is due based on mileage or time	Medium
Reminder Notification System	Provide alerts for upcoming maintenance tasks	Medium
UI Layout & Dashboard Design	Develop clean dashboard layout for usability	Medium
Input Validation & Error Handling	Prevent invalid form submissions and improve reliability	Medium
Deployment Environment Setup	Configure hosting and deployment platform	Medium
Basic Unit Testing Setup	Establish testing framework for validation	Low
3. User Stories
User Story 1

As a motorcycle owner, I want to create an account so that my maintenance data is securely stored and accessible anytime.

User Story 2

As a rider, I want to add my motorcycle’s details so that I can track maintenance specific to my bike.

User Story 3

As a rider, I want to log a maintenance event so that I can maintain a complete and accurate service history.

User Story 4

As a rider, I want to view my maintenance history in chronological order so that I can easily review past services.

User Story 5

As a rider, I want to update my motorcycle’s mileage so that future maintenance tracking is accurate.

4. Sprint Plan – Sprint 1

Sprint Duration: 2 Weeks

Sprint Goal

Establish the core application foundation by implementing user authentication, database structure, and motorcycle profile management.

Sprint Backlog Items Selected

User Authentication System

Database Schema Design

Create Motorcycle Profile

Update Mileage Feature

UI Layout & Dashboard Design

Justification

These items were selected because they establish the structural and architectural foundation of MotoTrack. Authentication and database design are required before any user-specific data can be stored. Motorcycle profile creation and mileage tracking are core features that enable future functionality such as maintenance logging and reminders. By focusing on foundational features first, we reduce technical risk and ensure a stable base for future sprints.

6. Reflection
Elijah Garnes

The most challenging aspect of Agile for this project will be maintaining disciplined scope control within each sprint. It is easy to want to implement advanced features too early, but Agile requires focusing on incremental and testable functionality. Delivering small, functional components each sprint will require prioritization and consistent communication.

Agile practices will reduce project failure by encouraging early validation of core functionality. By building foundational components first and reviewing progress frequently, we can identify issues early, adapt priorities, and reduce the risk of large-scale rework later in the semester.

Levi Green

The most challenging part of Agile will be maintaining consistent progress while balancing other academic responsibilities. Short sprint cycles require accountability and regular communication.

Agile will reduce the risk of project failure by breaking development into manageable iterations. Instead of attempting to complete everything at once, we will continuously test, evaluate, and improve the system. This approach improves adaptability and ensures steady progress toward the final product.
